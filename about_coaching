### What to expect from a coaching session with me

I'll ask you to bring a topic to our session that is currently important and unresolved to you. This could be something personal or professional that you are struggling with or seeking to improve upon. By focusing our sessions around a specific topic, we can work together to explore solutions, identify new perspectives, and develop actionable steps that move you towards your desired outcomes.

Some examples of coaching topics may include:

Navigating a challenging work relationship and seeking to enhance it
Preparing for a difficult conversation or addressing a specific conflict
Leading change within your organization or team
Developing the skills and potential of team members
Managing a significant life transition or change
Facilitating more productive and effective meetings
Preparing for presentations or public speaking opportunities
Planning for retirement or navigating a career transition
Working towards a personal challenge or goal that is meaningful to you
Rather than prescribing answers or solutions, I will actively listen to you and reflect back what I hear to help you gain a deeper understanding of what matters most to you. I'll ask thought-provoking questions that help you gain new insights and perspectives on your situation. In addition, I'll help you become more aware of the choices available to you, empowering you to make informed decisions that align with your values and goals. I'll also motivate you to follow through on your own ideas and take action towards achieving your desired outcomes.
