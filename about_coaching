### What to expect from a coaching session with me

I'll ask you to bring a topic to our session that is currently important and unresolved to you. This could be something personal or professional that you are struggling with or seeking to improve upon. By focusing our sessions around a specific topic, we can work together to explore solutions, identify new perspectives, and develop actionable steps that move you towards your desired outcomes.

Some examples of coaching topics may include:

- Navigating a challenging work relationship and seeking to enhance it
- Preparing for a difficult conversation or addressing a specific conflict
- Leading change within your organization or team
- Developing the skills and potential of team members
- Managing a significant life transition or change
- Facilitating more productive and effective meetings
- Preparing for presentations or public speaking opportunities
- Planning for retirement or navigating a career transition
- Working towards a personal challenge or goal that is meaningful to you

Rather than prescribing answers or solutions, I will actively listen to you and reflect back what I hear to help you gain a deeper understanding of what matters most to you. I'll ask thought-provoking questions that help you gain new insights and perspectives on your situation. In addition, I'll help you become more aware of the choices available to you, empowering you to make informed decisions that align with your values and goals. I'll also motivate you to follow through on your own ideas and take action towards achieving your desired outcomes.

### Tips for preparing for our coaching session:
- Choose a topic that you would like us to focus on
- Find a comfortable and private space free from distractions for the duration of our session
- Allow yourself a 15-minute buffer before and after the session to get into the right mindset and to process our discussion
- Since our session will be over the phone, you don't have to worry about screen fatigue or your appearance
- If you like to take notes, have a notepad or device handy
- Please keep in mind that I am still in training and may not get everything perfect. I appreciate your patience and understanding.

### Coaching versus mentoring versus therapy 
Often people ask about how coaching is different from therapy. One of the key differences is that in coaching, we will be focused on the present and the future, rather than digging in to the past. Another key difference is that in coaching, you'll come with a specific topic and we'll focus on it rather than have a stream of consciousness discussion.

People also often ask about how coaching relationships is different from mentoring ones. Generally, a mentor is someone who has expertise and offers advice to someone with less experience. In contrast, coaches might not not have substantive expertise in the industry or area of their clients. The role of a coach is not to offer advice but instead to guide a client through a process of self-discovery and problem-solving to achieve their goals.

Coaching sessions are confidential. When I hold a session with you, I will not share what we discuss with others and I will not record or take detailed notes.
