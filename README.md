## Sign up for a coaching session with me 

Hi there. After spending years providing client-centered legal services and coaching government teams through organizational change, I've decided to pursue my passion for coaching by undergoing training from Brown University. I'm on my way to becoming a certified leadership and executive coach, accredited by the International Coaching Federation (ICF).

Would you be interested in receiving some coaching? As part of my certification process, I'm offering free 45-minute coaching sessions and I would love for you to sign up for one! You can schedule a session with me here.

My goal is to help you gain clarity, identify your goals, and provide support and accountability to help you achieve them. If you find our coaching session valuable, I hope we can continue our work together over the course of several sessions. Let's work together to unlock your full potential!

### What to expect from a coaching session with me <a name="What to expect from a coaching session with me"></a>

I'll ask you to bring a topic to our session that is currently important and unresolved to you. This could be something personal or professional that you are struggling with or seeking to improve upon. By focusing our sessions around a specific topic, we can work together to explore solutions, identify new perspectives, and develop actionable steps that move you towards your desired outcomes.

Some examples of coaching topics may include:

- Navigating a challenging work relationship and seeking to enhance it
- Preparing for a difficult conversation or addressing a specific conflict
- Leading change within your organization or team
- Developing the skills and potential of team members
- Managing a significant life transition or change
- Facilitating more productive and effective meetings
- Preparing for presentations or public speaking opportunities
- Planning for retirement or navigating a career transition
- Working towards a personal challenge or goal that is meaningful to you

Rather than prescribing answers or solutions, I will actively listen to you and reflect back what I hear to gain a deeper understanding of what matters most to you. I'll ask thought-provoking questions that help you gain new insights and perspectives on your situation. In addition, I'll help you become more aware of the choices available to you, empowering you to make informed decisions that align with your values and goals. I'll also motivate you to follow through on your own ideas and take action towards achieving your desired outcomes.

<b> Tips for preparing for our coaching session: </b>
- Choose a topic that you would like us to focus on
- Find a comfortable and private space free from distractions for the duration of our session
- Allow yourself a 15-minute buffer before and after the session to get into the right mindset and to process our discussion
- Since our session will be over the phone, you don't have to worry about screen fatigue or your appearance
- If you like to take notes, have a notepad or device handy
- Please keep in mind that I am still in training and may not get everything perfect. I appreciate your patience and understanding.

#### Coaching versus mentoring versus therapy <a name="Coaching versus mentoring versus therapy"></a>
<i> Often people ask about how coaching is different from therapy.</i> One of the key differences is that in coaching, we will be focused on the present and the future, rather than digging in to the past. Another key difference is that in coaching, you'll come with a specific topic and we'll focus on it rather than have a stream of consciousness discussion.

<i>People also often ask about how coaching relationships is different from mentoring ones.</i> Generally, a mentor is someone who has expertise and offers advice to someone with less experience. In contrast, coaches might not not have substantive expertise in the industry or area of their clients. The role of a coach is not to offer advice but instead to guide a client through a process of self-discovery and problem-solving to achieve their goals.

Coaching sessions are confidential. When I hold a session with you, I will not share what we discuss with others and I will not record or take detailed notes.


#### My journey to coaching <a name="My journey to coaching"></a>

How did I choose this path? I had my first experience with leadership coaching through the Treasury Executive Institute while I was working with 18F, a digital services consultancy housed within the federal government. At the time, I was transitioning from being an individual contributor to managing teams. The experience opended doors for me, expanding my ideas of what was possible for both me and the teams that I was leading. That was years ago. I have continued to work with coaches over the years to help me when I hit road blocks or when I need support with stepping outside of my comfort zone. 

Since then, I've continued to work with coaches to help me push through roadblocks and step outside my comfort zone. It's been an incredible journey and the coaches that I've worked with have helped me develop greater range and resilience in many areas of my life. Having the privilege of receiving guidance and support from some amazing coaches has been a great source of inspiration for me. It has encouraged me to want to help others in their personal and professional development. I'm looking forward to learning and developing the valuable skills that my coaches have honed over time.
