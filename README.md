## Sign up for a coaching session with me 

Hi there. After spending years providing client-centered legal services and coaching government teams through organizational change, I've decided to pursue my passion for coaching by undergoing training from Brown University. I'm on my way to becoming a certified leadership and executive coach, accredited by the [International Coaching Federation (ICF)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Coaching_Federation).

Would you be interested in receiving some coaching? As part of my certification process, I'm offering free 45-minute coaching sessions and I would love for you to sign up for one!

#### My journey to coaching 

I had my first experience with leadership coaching through the [Treasury Executive Institute (TEI)](https://home.tei.treasury.gov/) while I was working with [18F](https://www.18f.gov), a digital services consultancy housed within the federal government. At the time, I was transitioning from being an individual contributor to managing teams. The experience opended doors for me, expanding my ideas of what was possible for both me and the teams that I was leading. That was years ago. I have continued to work with coaches over the years to help me when I hit road blocks or when I need support with stepping outside of my comfort zone. 

Since then, I've continued to work with coaches to help me push through roadblocks and step outside my comfort zone. It's been an incredible journey and the coaches that I've worked with have helped me develop greater range and resilience in many areas of my life. Having the privilege of receiving guidance and support from some amazing coaches has been a great source of inspiration for me. It has encouraged me to want to help others in their personal and professional development.
