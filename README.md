## Sign up for a coaching session with me 

After nearly two decades of providing client-centered legal services and coaching government teams through organizational change, I'm in the process of developing more formal leadership and performance coaching skills by undergoing training from Brown University. The program that I'm enrolled in, [Act Leadership](https://actleader.com/leadership-and-performance-coaching-certification/index.php?gclid=Cj0KCQjwmN2iBhCrARIsAG_G2i5RILczJFK9usxX2Vvng7lyiKANLNV3tTItxmflh5SUnTlEFUgUk7AaAsM1EALw_wcB](https://actleader.com/coach-2/)), is accredited by the [International Coaching Federation (ICF)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Coaching_Federation).

As part of my training and certification process, I have to complete hours of experience coaching clients. If you have a work or life issue that you'd like help thinking through, I'd love to help. I'm offering free 45-minute coaching sessions. <b>You can schedule a session with me [here](https://calendly.com/nikzei/coaching-session).</b>


## What to expect from a coaching session with me

I'll ask you to bring a topic to our session that is currently important and unresolved to you. This could be something personal or professional that you are struggling with or seeking to improve upon. By focusing our sessions around a specific topic, we'll work together to explore solutions, identify new perspectives, and develop actionable steps that move you towards your desired outcomes.

Some examples of coaching topics may include:

- Navigating a challenging work relationship and seeking to enhance it
- Preparing for a difficult conversation or addressing a specific conflict
- Leading change within your organization or team
- Developing the skills and potential of team members
- Managing a significant life transition or change
- Facilitating more productive and effective meetings
- Preparing for presentations or public speaking opportunities
- Planning for retirement or navigating a career transition
- Working towards a personal challenge or goal that is meaningful to you

During our session, I won't be giving advice. Instead, I'll actively listen and reflect back what I hear to help you ground yourself in what matters most to you. I'll ask questions to help you gain insights and perspectives on your situation. My intention will be to help you become more aware of the choices available to you and to encourage you to make informed decisions that align with your values and goals. We will close out our session by identifying what actions you'd like take to move things forward.  

Coaching sessions are confidential. When I hold a session with you, I will not share what we discuss with others and I will not record or take detailed notes.

### Tips for preparing for our coaching session:
- Choose a topic that you would like us to focus on
- Find a comfortable and private space free from distractions for the duration of our session
- If possible, allow yourself a 15-minute buffer before and after the session to get into the right mindset and to process our discussion
- Since our session will be over the phone, you don't have to worry about screen fatigue or your appearance
- If you like to take notes, have a notepad or device handy
- Please keep in mind that I am still in training and may not get everything perfect. I appreciate your patience and understanding.

### A note about coaching versus mentoring versus therapy 
Often people ask about how coaching is different from therapy. One of the key differences is that in coaching, we will be focused on the present and the future, rather than digging in to the past. Another key difference is that in coaching, you'll come with a specific topic and we'll focus on it rather than have a stream of consciousness discussion.

People also often ask about how coaching relationships is different from mentoring ones. Generally, a mentor is someone who has expertise and offers advice to someone with less experience. In contrast, coaches might not not have substantive expertise in the industry or area of their clients. The role of a coach is not to offer advice but instead to guide a client through a process of self-discovery and problem-solving to achieve their goals.



## My journey to coaching 

I had my first experience with leadership coaching through the [Treasury Executive Institute (TEI)](https://home.tei.treasury.gov/) while I was working with [18F](https://www.18f.gov), a digital services consultancy housed within the federal government. At the time, I was transitioning away from being an individual contributor and towards managing teams. Having trained as a lawyer, I carried many skills that were helpful but also some that got in the way. I was used to working independently and sometimes this made me less inclined to rely on teammates. I was versed in navigating adversarial relationships but sometimes I found myself initially cautious about collaboration. I was accustomed to taking on the responsibility of being an expert but as my worked scaled up, I realized that it would be impossible for me to develop expertise in everything. As my responsibilities grew in leading others, I began working with a leadership coach from TEI, which offers free coaching services to leaders in government. The experience opended doors for me, expanding my ideas of what was possible for both me and the teams that I was leading. It also helped me learn that all of us are continually evolving and that its incredibly helpful to have support along the way. 

That was years ago. I have continued to work with coaches over the years to help me when I hit road blocks or when I need support with stepping outside of my comfort zone. The wonderful coaches that I've worked with have inspired me become a coach. I hope to apply what I learn in training by continuing to coach teams and individuals in government and also to offer coaching services independently. In addition to training with Act Leadrship, I've received training in somatic coaching from the [Strozzi Institute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strozzi_Institute).
